This is just a test run to understand how GH works 
We can keep adding configuration details, implementation details etc Github is very easy to understand. 

You can write all the description of your code and steps to run your app / project here. 

On Github saved changes are called "commits"

I here checked-in a small routine of how to count the number of characters in a String. This also checks for a "null"
